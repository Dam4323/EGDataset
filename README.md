# EGDataset

Exploration Global Dataset is a dataset provided by a hybrid model to perform malware detection on Android applications. This dataset is based on a hybrid model (static and dynamic analysis) with an exploration approach.

# Purpose
The approach used to obtain this dataset investigates the general application's features. Then this performs some investigations on the several nodes to analyze the global app behavior.Finally, you can read the result obtained after using machine learning analysis on the dataset (Random Forest and SVM algorithms) and a k-folds approach with ten occurrences.

|Algorithms|Accuracy|Precision|Recall|F1_Score
Random Forest|0.957|0.957|0.957|0.957
SVM|0.945|0.945|0.945|0.945


# Availability
This dataset is under an open-source license, but the model's code is unavailable for privacy reasons. However, if you have any questions before using it, you can contact me by e-mail (damien.strullu@gmail.com) or Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/damienstrullu/).

# Special Thanks

This dataset is obtained due to the participation "VirusShare" (https://virusshare.com/) and "VirusTotal" (https://www.virustotal.com/) to perform some detection on the sample data provided.
